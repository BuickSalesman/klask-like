# Most Recent Events Summary

    Created client, server, and shared directories
    Created src directory in both client and server

# Next Steps

    Create an index.html within client
        - Put a canvas on in
        - Research and install(?) 2DCanvas

    Figure out what needs to go in client and sever

## MVP/Theory
    * An up to 30 player klask-like air hockey-like
    * Two teams of 15 each
    * You try to knock the good-puck into the opposing goal to win
    * Avoid the two bad-pucks, if you they hit you twice you are eliminated until the next round begins
        + Bad-pucks slightly magnetic?
        + Bad-bucks can be hit by the good-puck
    * Score points by being the last player standing, or getting the puck into the opponents goal
    * First to 7? wins. Quick gammes.
    * Cannot cross center line? y/n?
    * Going into your own goal eliminates you?

## Technologies

    2D Canvas?
        - gippity said this was the best canvas to use, but I did not look into it yet

    Rapier
        - Rust!
        - Super fast?
        - Looked up the 2D demos of it and breifly skimmed the getting started doc
        - This is not the entire server, just the math parts

    Websockets
        - But what is that?
